# Computer-Vision

Automatic Object Detection Training Pipeline with Florence-2 & YOLO The goal of this project is to automate the creation of labeled training datasets using the Florence-2 vision-language model to train custom object detection models. It focuses on overcoming the challenge of manual annotation to develop efficient models capable of running on edge devices
